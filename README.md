🎯 Key Highlights
1. Elegant Theme System
Seamless dark/light mode toggle with smooth transitions

System preference detection and localStorage persistence

Distinct visual identities for both themes:

Light Mode: Clean, professional with subtle grids and soft gradients

Custom floating animations on cards

Staggered entry animations for content

Interactive hover states with spring physics

Noise overlay and particle effects for depth

3. Professional Design
Clean typography with careful spacing

Accessible color contrasts

Responsive across all devices

Focus states for keyboard navigation

4. Technical Excellence
Built with React 18 + TypeScript

Framer Motion for smooth animations

Tailwind CSS for styling

Component-based architecture

Context API for theme management
